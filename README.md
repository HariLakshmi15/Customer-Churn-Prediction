# Customer Churn Prediction using ANN (Google Colab)

This project predicts whether a customer is likely to churn using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN).  
The entire workflow was developed and executed using **Google Colab**.

⚠️ Note: GitHub may not render the notebook preview due to file size.  
Please download the notebook and open it in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.

## 📌 Problem Statement
Customer churn is a critical problem for subscription-based businesses.  
This project aims to identify customers who are at risk of leaving so that retention strategies can be applied.

## 🧠 Model Overview
- Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
- Binary classification (Churn / No Churn)

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Google Colab
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Streamlit (for UI)
- Ngrok (for temporary deployment)

## 📊 Features Used
- Age  
- Gender  
- Tenure  
- Usage Frequency  
- Support Calls  
- Payment Delay  
- Subscription Type  
- Contract Length  
- Total Spend  
- Last Interaction  

> CustomerID was removed before training as it is an identifier and not a predictive feature.

## 🚀 Workflow
1. Data preprocessing and encoding
2. Feature scaling using StandardScaler
3. ANN model training
4. Model evaluation
5. Model saving and loading
6. Prediction on new customer data
7. Streamlit-based deployment

## ✅ Output
- Churn probability score
- Prediction indicating whether the customer is likely to stay or churn
